# My Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website where I share my projects, skills, and background as a software developer.
I built this to create a space where I can keep track of what I’m working on and make it easier for others to explore my work.

Coming soon

## ✨ About

I’m currently pursuing B.Tech IT and actively building projects in full-stack development and machine learning.
The goal of this portfolio is simple — show what I’ve built and what I’m capable of, instead of only talking about it.

I update the site whenever I complete a new project or earn a certification.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

React + Vite — UI & build setup

Bootstrap — layout, responsive design

JavaScript, HTML, CSS — core frontend

GitHub Pages / Vercel — deployment (planned)

## 📁 Projects Featured

### Real Time Crack Detection System

### Complaint Management System

### Personalized Expense Tracker

Each project page includes a short description, screenshots, tech stack, and a link to the source code.
